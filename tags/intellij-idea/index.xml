      <description>&lt;p&gt;The remote development feature allows its users to have an IDE or a code editor server on a remote machine.
All the local machine needs is a client that draws an interface, and sends, and receives data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is already pushing in this direction: VSCode was the first to introduce this feature.
It&amp;rsquo;s much easier for VSCode since it&amp;rsquo;s a code editor built on electron (JS), while for example, IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE and uses Java Swing library for UI.&lt;br&gt;
In Autumn 2022, JetBrains also caught this trend and announced a remote development feature for its products and a completely new IDE built from scratch that also supports this feature.
GitHub has also introduced a remote development feature which allows using VSCode in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
