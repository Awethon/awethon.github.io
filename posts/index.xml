      <description>The remote development feature allows you to use IDE or code editor on a remote machine. All that local machine needs is a client that draws interface, sends, and receives data, like a browser.
VSCode was the first to introduce this feature. Things are much easier for VSCode since it&amp;rsquo;s a code editor built on electron, while for example, IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE and uses Java Swing library for UI.</description>

      <title>Different ways to implement wrappers in Scala 2.x</title>

      <description>The wrapper pattern (or the proxy pattern) is a useful way of adding extra logic to methods of a class: logging, metering, tracing, timeouts, retries. It helps to keep code clean and focused on business logic.
Scala is a great language and provides many ways to create wrappers. Maybe even too many.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to create this article because it seems that there&amp;rsquo;s no consensus among Scala developers on how to write them and no clear understanding of downsides and limitations.</description>
